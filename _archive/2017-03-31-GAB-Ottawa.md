All around the world user groups and communities want to learn about Azure and Cloud Computing! On **April 22, 2017**, all communities will come together once again in the fifth great [Global Azure Bootcamp](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/) event!

This year I will be presenting at the Global Azure Bootcamp in Ottawa, Canada. if you are located in Ottawa or nearby and would like to learn about Microsoft Azure, I highly recommend that you join this event.
