I had the pleasure of presenting two sessions at satAZUREday here in Ottawa. In my first presentation, I discussed Azure Dev/Test Labs and creating a CI/CD pipeline with Visual Studio Team Services. In my second session, I discussed the importance of determining the governance of your subscriptions to ensure developers follow the set policies without giving up agility.
