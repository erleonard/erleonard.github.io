July 1st is a day of joy and anxiety for me as I celebrate Canada day with my family but also constantly refreshing my inbox to see if I got renew as a Microsoft MVP. I'm very proud and grateful to have received my 3rd Microsoft MVP award for Azure. This is a select group in Canada where we are about 20 and I look forward to continuing to collaborate with them and the broader community.

Looking forward to adding another ring to my award.

Happy Canada Day!
