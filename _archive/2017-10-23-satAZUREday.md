I’m proud to announce that in am organizing and speaking at satAzureday here in Ottawa.

Azure Saturday is a community-driven event for Developers, IT-Pros and Cloud Architects.

The conference takes place on November 18th (SatAzureDay) in Ottawa (Canada) and features both tech-talks and practical use-cases of Azure. The tech-talks are a great way to learn, and the practical uses-cases will provide inspiration and insight into real-world Azure solutions.

The conference workshops are led by subject matter experts and are a great way to dive into a specific area to take your Azure-skills to the next level. Whether you work with Azure on a daily basis or want to get more involved with Azure these professional workshops will provide valuable knowledge.
