During the keynote on day 1 of the Microsoft Build 2017 conference, Azure Mobile Application was announced.  This application allows an administrator to check on various resources in their subscriptions and perform some basic functionality, receive important notifications and in the future access the Azure Cloud Shell.

Here are the features that are listed in the Google Play Store:

- Stay connected to the cloud and check status and critical metrics anytime, anywhere
- Stay informed with notifications and alerts about important health issues
- Stay in control of your resources and take corrective actions, like starting and stopping VMs and web apps

The app is currently available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.azure) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-azure/id1219013620).

Here is a quick video of the app from my Android device to demonstrate some of the features and notification.
